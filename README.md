## üîß Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone and Install Dependencies

```bash
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd job-tracker-app

### 2. Firebase Configuration

1. Create a new Firebase project at [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/)
2. Enable Authentication (Email/Password)
3. Create a Firestore database
4. Enable Storage
5. Get your Firebase config from Project Settings

### 3. Configure Firebase

  storageBucket: "your-project.appspot.com",
  messagingSenderId: "your-sender-id",
  appId: "your-app-id"
};
```

### 4. Firestore Security Rules

Set up Firestore security rules to ensure data security:

```javascript
rules_version = '2';
service cloud.firestore {
  match /databases/{database}/documents {
    match /jobs/{jobId} {
      allow read, write: if request.auth != null && request.auth.uid == resource.data.userId;
      allow create: if request.auth != null && request.auth.uid == request.resource.data.userId;
    }
  }
}
```

### 5. Storage Security Rules

Set up Storage security rules:

```javascript
rules_version = '2';
service firebase.storage {
  match /b/{bucket}/o {
    match /attachments/{userId}/{allPaths=**} {
      allow read, write: if request.auth != null && request.auth.uid == userId;
    }
  }
}
```
